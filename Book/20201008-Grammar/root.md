# Grammar

- Making robots learn skills incrementally is an efficient way to design real intelligent agents.
- knowledge-distillation-based methods
- 3D object detection is one of the important problems of perception in autonomous driving.
- It allows vehicles to recognize and locate key objects in the 3D space from sensor readings.
- researchers have made great process in teaching robots to detect object-of-interests from its surroundings.
- must spend huge effort to do sth.
- facilitate sb/sth to do sth
- with/without comma before "and"/"but"
- The current IL research
- Li \textit{et al.} \cite{li20173d}
- "facilitate" has to apply to an action
- it 有时可以用this代替
-  A method can't be directly represented by the word "work".
The general meaning of "work" to mean physical or mental effort doesn't function as you are using it here,
and the specialized countable meaning, i.e., a work/works,
has very restricted applications,
one of which is to mean a paper/papers.
- constraints
- I always abuse the ":"
- Our dual-network learning framework is as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dual_network_arch}.
- There should never be more than one colon in a sentence.
- 由...组成 be composed of
- We use the 3D average precision ($AP$) to evaluate the detection results as in \cite{kitti2012}.
- To simplify the description, we continue to use the notation in Section \ref{subsec:kd_based_task_il_in_3d_object_detection}.
- We set the initial learning rate to $0.1\gamma$ to avoid drifting greatly from $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A^*$.
- We attribute this to the fact that 
- it helps preserve old-task knowledge while keeping the plasticity of parametric models in learning new tasks
- This can be seen if we compare \textit{fine-tuning} with \textit{lwf-kd} in Table \ref{tab:exp-kitti-4+1}, \ref{tab:exp-kitti-2+3} and \ref{tab:exp-kitti-2+seq}.
- optimize the parameters in the direction maximizing
- a huge class imbalance.
- a similar order of instances
