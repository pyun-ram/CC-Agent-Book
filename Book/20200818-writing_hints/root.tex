\section{Try to use active voice}
    According to Stefan King's advice,
    using active voice is more natural.
    Using passive voice will make the description
    seems lack of confident.

\section{Use the most accurate word}
    The paper \cite{Liu2020} uses a lot of uncommon words,
    which makes the reading of this paper incoherent.
    For example, "While we expected EIML to dominate IDA,..."
    The authors intended to express "While we expected EIML perform better than IDA,...".
    The word "dominate" might confuses readers.
    They may ask questions in their mind, like
    "Is there any other meanings of dominant besides better?".
